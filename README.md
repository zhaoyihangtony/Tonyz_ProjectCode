 The Code Summary  
This is my project code summary:  
* __Claculating Data Sets__ : code in this folder is used to turn the known data into the data you want by formula calculation. There are also functions for changing the data type.
* __Linear Programming__ : This part of the code is used to process the collected data, transform its format into data that can be trained and tested, and then perform linear programming, in which many different algorithms are used to train the data. And also set up different constrains.
* __Regression__ : The code in this file is the application of various basic regression algorithms to the collected and processed data.
* __Stats Data scratch__ ï¼šIt contains the code to capture data on the website through the API, as well as processing the original data, making the original data becomes usable data, and the data is filtered and saved.
* __TimeSeries__ : The code inside is to implement a time series algorithm, and the data is predicted by this algorithm.
