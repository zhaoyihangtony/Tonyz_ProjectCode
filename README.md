 The Code Summary  
This is my project code summary:  
* Claculating Data Sets : code in this folder is used to turn the known data into the data you want by formula calculation. There are also functions for changing the data type.
* Linear Programming : This part of the code is used to process the collected data, transform its format into data that can be trained and tested, and then perform linear programming, in which many different algorithms are used to train the data. And also set up different constrains.
